This is a symbol file for analyzing crashes or bugs in WordPerfect8.

!! You *do not* need this file unless you're a developer trying to debug a problem. !!

To use this file with gdb, attach to the wp process and type:

```
(gdb) add-symbol-file /path/to/wp.dbg
```

You should now be able to set breakpoints, and examine the callstack.
